# libminer

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of libminer is to provide the user with an overview of your R library setup. It is a toy package created as a part of the posit::conf(2023) and not meant for serious use!

## Installation

You can install the development version of libminer from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("amason30/libminer")
```

## Example

To get a count of installed packages in each of your libraries, optionally with the total sizes, use `lib_summaary()`.

```{r example}
library(libminer)
## basic example code

lib_summary()
```
